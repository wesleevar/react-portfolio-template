          Even though we have to code constantly for className, this is
          something that I genuinely enjoy learning in my free time.

          Especially for when it comes to
          <strong>web-development</strong>, where the creative opportunities are
          literally endless, I find myself spending hours going down rabbit
          holes of formative exploration.

          I started rock climbing about 2 years ago, and since then, it has been
          nothing short of amazing (maybe even
          <em>addicting</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the challenge of finding the optimal "beta" through a problem,
          and pushing your body to it's limit.

          I joined PCT (a professional business fraternity) my very first
          semesert at BU. It was probably one of the most impactfuly decsions
          I've made in terms of the
          <strong>friends</strong> made, <strong>skills</strong> acquired, and
          abundance of unique experiences. (Feel free to check out our website
          WhyPhi 😜)

        <p>
          Growing up, I always had the opportunity to watch my mom cook, and
          even help out in the kitchen. Once my parents started working more, I
          ended up taking more responsibility for cooking meals for the whole
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          This slowly grew into a passion, and now is something that I spend a
          lot of free time doing for fun!
